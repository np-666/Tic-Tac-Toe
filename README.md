## Welcome to a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game powered by AI

This is a simple game powered by the Min-Max algorithm. This was a part of my learning experimentation.
Have used a simple and minimalistic dark design powered by Tailwind CSS.
You can find more information and documentation of Tailwind CSS [here](https://tailwindcss.com)
Also, please check the working of min-max algorithm [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mini-max-algorithm-in-artificial-intelligence)
